# Installation

This package is available as a composer library and as a npm package.

You're not forced to use both, you can use only one of them. The php implementation is using [Modularity](https://github.com/inpsyde/modularity) a modular [PSR-11](https://github.com/php-fig/container) implementation for WordPress Plugins, Themes and Libraries.
The JavaScript implementation is composed of a set of utilities and React components to help you build your own UI.

## Composer

```bash
composer require spaghetti-dojo/wp-entities-search
```
